# Project-Euler-Solutions
I am interested in computer science and mathematics.I am strived to write clean and simple dynamic programming code for 
"Project Euler problems" solutions. I used java for all problems that I solved. Also I choosed the variables carefully 
to avoid integer overflow or low speed.
For the problems you can visit projecteuler.net Enjoy!
Also you can check my progress https://projecteuler.net/profile/AyberkAktepe.png

You probably need to know couple of things for figure it out how my code work. There is a short list for you. You may 
prefer to read those wikipedia articles.

Number Theory
Discrete Mathematics
Game Theory
Graph Theory
Geometry
Combinatorics
